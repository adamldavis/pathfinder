	<p>
		This library contains an interface for a two-dimensional
		world in which to find a path and an interface for an algorithm
		for finding that path.  It also contains three implementations
		of path finders, two of which are for demonstration, and one of
		which is optimized for speed and efficiency.   The jar file is
		runnable and contains an applet for demonstrating the efficiency
		of the algorithm.</P>
		
		<P>This library can be plugged into any application, such as an
		RPG game, needing an AI for quickly determining a path through a
		2D block world.
